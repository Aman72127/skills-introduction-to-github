Hello everyone My name is Aman kumar tripathi and,

I’m truly honored to be here today to share a few thoughts with you.

While pursuing Data Science and Business Analytics , I can see world through a different overview—that changes how we think , how we take big decisions and solve problems and even understand people.

Today, I want to talk about something close to my heart:
Why I believe that learning data science is like gaining a modern-day superpower.

 

Now let me ask you if you get the chance to choose your superpowers? What it would be

Flying? Invisibility? Reading minds? Super strength?

Now imagine this: what if there is a superpower that is already in existence that help us predict behaviour , to find hidden symmetry and also ability to influence major changes in business , health care industries.

That power is called data science.
And the best part? You don’t need the spider to bit you to get this magic power. It can be obtained by willingness to learn and develop new skills.

Let me share a story which give example of how powerful data science can be.

A few years ago, business developed a model to understand and even predict customer buying behaviour. Their data scientists who were working on this model discovered that by following certain purchases—like unscented lotion and vitamin supplements—they could predict when a woman was more likely pregnant.

In one case, buisiness sent maternity-related coupons to a teenage girl. Her father saw them before she could see it and he was furious—until he realized that her daughter actually was pregnant.
SO that’s the magic the model figured it out , before her family did.

Now, the question arises . is this creepy? Yes.
Is it powerful? Absolutely.
That’s the power of data science—it reveals what’s hidden, even from ourselves.

I had a similar, though much smaller experience during my work at a company.

For  a company which was b2c , I won’t take the name but I used to track their daily sales and found the sales was going low each evening . I tracked partner active data and found some of them were going for festival each evening. We talked it out replaced new partners and the sale hiked in just few days

So why do I call it a superpower?

Because:

It gives you X-ray vision—you can see patterns that others overlook.
It gives you the power to predict—to predict forecast sales, risks, and trends before they actually happen.
It gives you influence—because those who can read it hold the power to change things.
And the best part?
It’s not limited to scientists. Anyone—students, artists, business owners—can learn to use this power.

Well with any great power comes great responsibility and  data science comes with responsibility.

We live in a world where data can be used to manipulate, deceive, or even invade privacy.
That’s why we need ethical, thoughtful people to lead this field. People who would take permission to build any model .

Because it’s not just about what data can do—it’s about what we choose to do with it.

So here’s the idea I want to leave with you:

Learning data science is like learning a superpower—because it helps you understand the world in ways others can’t, and gives you the tools to make it better.

Whether you want to grow a business, solve a social problem, or just make smarter decisions in everyday life—this skill is for you.

You don’t need to wear a cape.
You just need to keep asking questions—and let the data answer.

Thank you so much.
